/*2.4.1 Reserved Words
 The following words are part of the JavaScript language. Many of
 these (such as if, while, and for) are reserved keywords that must
 not be used as the names of constants, variables, functions, or classes
 (though they can all be used as the names of properties within an
 object). Others (such as from, of, get, and set) are used in limited
 contexts with no syntactic ambiguity ( Ambiguity (ইংরেজি শব্দ) এর বাংলা অর্থ হলো দ্ব্যর্থতা, অস্পষ্টতা, বা অনির্দিষ্টতা।) and are perfectly legal as
 identifiers. Still other keywords (such as let) can’t be fully reserved
 in order to retain backward compatibility with older programs, and so
 there are complex rules that govern when they can be used as
 identifiers and when they cannot. (let can be used as a variable name
 if declared with var outside of a class, for example, but not if declared
 inside a class or with const.) The simplest course is to avoid using
 any of these words as identifiers, except for from, set, and target,
 which are safe to use and are already in common use.

 JavaScript also reserves or restricts the use of certain keywords that are
 not currently used by the language but that might be used in future
 versions:
 enum  implements  interface  package  private  protected  
public
 For historical reasons, arguments and eval are not allowed as
 identifiers in certain circumstances and are best avoided entirely.*/
