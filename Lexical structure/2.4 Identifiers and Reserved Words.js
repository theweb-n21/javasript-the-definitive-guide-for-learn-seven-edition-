/*2.4 Identifiers and Reserved Words
 An identifier is simply a name. In JavaScript, identifiers are used to
 name constants, variables, properties, functions, and classes and to
 provide labels for certain loops in JavaScript code. A JavaScript
 identifier must begin with a letter, an underscore (_), or a dollar sign
 ($). Subsequent characters can be letters, digits, underscores, or dollar
 signs. (Digits are not allowed as the first character so that JavaScript
 can easily distinguish identifiers from numbers.) These are all legal
 identifiers:*/
 i
 my_variable_name
 v13
 _dummy
 $str
 /*Like any language, JavaScript reserves certain identifiers for use by the
 language itself. These “reserved words” cannot be used as regular
 identifiers. They are listed in the next section.*/
