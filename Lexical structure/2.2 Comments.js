 2.2 Comments
 JavaScript supports two styles of comments. Any text between a //
 and the end of a line is treated as a comment and is ignored by
 JavaScript. Any text between the characters /* and */// is also treated
 //as a comment; these comments may span multiple lines but may not be
 //nested. The following lines of code are all legal JavaScript comments:
 // This is a single-line comment.
 /* This is also a comment */  // and here is another comment.
 /*
 * This is a multi-line comment. The extra * characters at 
the start of
 * each line are not a required part of the syntax; they just 
look cool!
 *
