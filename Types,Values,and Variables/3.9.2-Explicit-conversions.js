/** 3.9.2 Explicit Conversions
 Although JavaScript performs many type conversions automatically,
you may sometimes need to perform an explicit conversion, or you
 may prefer to make the conversions explicit to keep your code clearer.
 The simplest way to perform an explicit type conversion is to use the
 Boolean(), Number(), and String() functions:
 Number("3")    
// => 3
 String(false)  // => "false":  Or use false.toString()
 Boolean([])    
// => true
 Any value other than null or undefined has a toString()
 method, and the result of this method is usually the same as that
 returned by the String() function.
 As an aside, note that the Boolean(), Number(), and String()
 functions can also be invoked—with new—as constructor. If you use
 them this way, you’ll get a “wrapper” object that behaves just like a
 primitive boolean, number, or string value. These wrapper objects are a
 historical leftover from the earliest days of JavaScript, and there is
 never really any good reason to use them.
 Certain JavaScript operators perform implicit type conversions and are
 sometimes used explicitly for the purpose of type conversion. If one
 operand of the + operator is a string, it converts the other one to a
 string. The unary + operator converts its operand to a number. And the
 unary ! operator converts its operand to a boolean and negates it.
 These facts lead to the following type conversion idioms that you may
 see in some code:
 x + ""   // => String(x)
+x       
x-0      
!!x      
// => Number(x)
 // => Number(x)
 // => Boolean(x): Note double !
 Formatting and parsing numbers are common tasks in computer
 programs, and JavaScript has specialized functions and methods that
 provide more precise control over number-to-string and string-to
number conversions.
 The toString() method defined by the Number class accepts an
 optional argument that specifies a radix, or base, for the conversion. If
 you do not specify the argument, the conversion is done in base 10.
 However, you can also convert numbers in other bases (between 2 and
 36). For example:
 let n = 17;
 let binary = "0b" + n.toString(2);  // binary == "0b10001"
 let octal = "0o" + n.toString(8);   // octal == "0o21"
 let hex = "0x" + n.toString(16);    
// hex == "0x11"
 When working with financial or scientific data, you may want to
 convert numbers to strings in ways that give you control over the
 number of decimal places or the number of significant digits in the
 output, or you may want to control whether exponential notation is
 used. The Number class defines three methods for these kinds of
 number-to-string conversions. toFixed() converts a number to a
 string with a specified number of digits after the decimal point. It never
 uses exponential notation. toExponential() converts a number to
 a string using exponential notation, with one digit before the decimal
 point and a specified number of digits after the decimal point (which
 means that the number of significant digits is one larger than the value
you specify). toPrecision() converts a number to a string with the
 number of significant digits you specify. It uses exponential notation if
 the number of significant digits is not large enough to display the entire
 integer portion of the number. Note that all three methods round the
 trailing digits or pad with zeros as appropriate. Consider the following
 examples:
 let n = 123456.789;
 n.toFixed(0)         
n.toFixed(2)         
n.toFixed(5)         
// => "123457"
 // => "123456.79"
 // => "123456.78900"
 n.toExponential(1)   // => "1.2e+5"
 n.toExponential(3)   // => "1.235e+5"
 n.toPrecision(4)     
n.toPrecision(7)     
// => "1.235e+5"
 // => "123456.8"
 n.toPrecision(10)    
// => "123456.7890"
 In addition to the number-formatting methods shown here, the
 Intl.NumberFormat class defines a more general, internationalized
 number-formatting method. See 
§11.7.1 for details.
 If you pass a string to the Number() conversion function, it attempts
 to parse that string as an integer or floating-point literal. That function
 only works for base-10 integers and does not allow trailing characters
 that are not part of the literal. The parseInt() and
 parseFloat() functions (these are global functions, not methods of
 any class) are more flexible. parseInt() parses only integers, while
 parseFloat() parses both integers and floating-point numbers. If a
 string begins with “0x” or “0X”, parseInt() interprets it as a
 hexadecimal number. Both parseInt() and parseFloat() skip
 leading whitespace, parse as many numeric characters as they can, and
ignore anything that follows. If the first nonspace character is not part
 of a valid numeric literal, they return NaN:
 parseInt("3 blind mice")     
// => 3
 parseFloat(" 3.14 meters")   // => 3.14
 parseInt("-12.34")           
// => -12
 parseInt("0xFF")             
parseInt("0xff")             
parseInt("-0XFF")            
parseFloat(".1")             
parseInt("0.1")              
parseInt(".1")               
with "."
 // => 255
 // => 255
 // => -255
 // => 0.1
 // => 0
 // => NaN: integers can't start 
parseFloat("$72.47")         
with "$"
 // => NaN: numbers can't start 
parseInt() accepts an optional second argument specifying the
 radix (base) of the number to be parsed. Legal values are between 2
 and 36. For example:
 parseInt("11", 2)     
parseInt("ff", 16)    
parseInt("zz", 36)    
parseInt("077", 8)    
// => 3: (1*2 + 1)
 // => 255: (15*16 + 15)
 // => 1295: (35*36 + 35)
 // => 63: (7*8 + 7)
 parseInt("077", 10)   // => 77: (7*10 + 7) */
