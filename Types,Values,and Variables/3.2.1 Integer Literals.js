/* 3.2.1 Integer Literals
 In a JavaScript program, a base-10 integer is written as a sequence of
 digits. For example:
 0
 3
 10000000
 In addition to base-10 integer literals, JavaScript recognizes
 hexadecimal (base-16) values. A hexadecimal literal begins with 0x or
 0X, followed by a string of hexadecimal digits. A hexadecimal digit is
 one of the digits 0 through 9 or the letters a (or A) through f (or F),
 which represent values 10 through 15. Here are examples of
 hexadecimal integer literals:
 0xff       // => 255: (15*16 + 15)
 0xBADCAFE  // => 195939070
 In ES6 and later, you can also express integers in binary (base 2) or
 octal (base 8) using the prefixes 0b and 0o (or 0B and 0O) instead of
 0x:
 0b10101  // => 21:  (1*16 + 0*8 + 1*4 + 0*2 + 1*1)
 0o377    // => 255: (3*64 + 7*8 + 7*1)*/
