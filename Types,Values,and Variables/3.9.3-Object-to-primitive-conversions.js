/** 3.9.3 Object to Primitive Conversions
 The previous sections have explained how you can explicitly convert
 values of one type to another type and have explained JavaScript’s
 implicit conversions of values from one primitive type to another
 primitive type. This section covers the complicated rules that
 JavaScript uses to convert objects to primitive values. It is long and
 obscure, and if this is your first reading of this chapter, you should feel
free to skip ahead to 
§3.10.
 One reason for the complexity of JavaScript’s object-to-primitive
 conversions is that some types of objects have more than one primitive
 representation. Date objects, for example, can be represented as strings
 or as numeric timestamps. The JavaScript specification defines three
 fundamental algorithms for converting objects to primitive values:
 prefer-string
 This algorithm returns a primitive value, preferring a string value,
 if a conversion to string is possible.
 prefer-number
 This algorithm returns a primitive value, preferring a number, if
 such a conversion is possible.
 no-preference
 This algorithm expresses no preference about what type of
 primitive value is desired, and classes can define their own
 conversions. Of the built-in JavaScript types, all except Date
 implement this algorithm as prefer-number. The Date class
 implements this algorithm as prefer-string.
 The implementation of these object-to-primitive conversion algorithms
 is explained at the end of this section. First, however, we explain how
 the algorithms are used in JavaScript.
 OBJECT-TO-BOOLEAN CONVERSIONS
 Object-to-boolean conversions are trivial: all objects convert to true.
 Notice that this conversion does not require the use of the object-to
primitive algorithms described, and that it literally applies to all
 objects, including empty arrays and even the wrapper object new
 Boolean(false).
 OBJECT-TO-STRING CONVERSIONS
 When an object needs to be converted to a string, JavaScript first
 converts it to a primitive using the prefer-string algorithm, then
 converts the resulting primitive value to a string, if necessary,
 following the rules in 
Table 3-2.
 This kind of conversion happens, for example, if you pass an object to
 a built-in function that expects a string argument, if you call
 String() as a conversion function, and when you interpolate objects
 into template literals (
 §3.3.4).
 OBJECT-TO-NUMBER CONVERSIONS
 When an object needs to be converted to a number, JavaScript first
 converts it to a primitive value using the prefer-number algorithm, then
 converts the resulting primitive value to a number, if necessary,
 following the rules in 
Table 3-2.
 Built-in JavaScript functions and methods that expect numeric
 arguments convert object arguments to numbers in this way, and most
 (see the exceptions that follow) JavaScript operators that expect
 numeric operands convert objects to numbers in this way as well.
 SPECIAL CASE OPERATOR CONVERSIONS
 Operators are covered in detail in 
Chapter 4. Here, we explain the
special case operators that do not use the basic object-to-string and
 object-to-number conversions described earlier.
 The + operator in JavaScript performs numeric addition and string
 concatenation. If either of its operands is an object, JavaScript converts
 them to primitive values using the no-preference algorithm. Once it has
 two primitive values, it checks their types. If either argument is a
 string, it converts the other to a string and concatenates the strings.
 Otherwise, it converts both arguments to numbers and adds them.
 The == and != operators perform equality and inequality testing in a
 loose way that allows type conversions. If one operand is an object and
 the other is a primitive value, these operators convert the object to
 primitive using the no-preference algorithm and then compare the two
 primitive values.
 Finally, the relational operators <, <=, >, and >= compare the order of
 their operands and can be used to compare both numbers and strings. If
 either operand is an object, it is converted to a primitive value using the
 prefer-number algorithm. Note, however, that unlike the object-to
number conversion, the primitive values returned by the prefer-number
 conversion are not then converted to numbers.
 Note that the numeric representation of Date objects is meaningfully
 comparable with < and >, but the string representation is not. For Date
 objects, the no-preference algorithm converts to a string, so the fact
 that JavaScript uses the prefer-number algorithm for these operators
 means that we can use them to compare the order of two Date objects.
THE TOSTRING() AND VALUEOF() METHODS
 All objects inherit two conversion methods that are used by object-to
primitive conversions, and before we can explain the prefer-string,
 prefer-number, and no-preference conversion algorithms, we have to
 explain these two methods.
 The first method is toString(), and its job is to return a string
 representation of the object. The default toString() method does
 not return a very interesting value (though we’ll find it useful in
 §14.4.3):
 ({x: 1, y: 2}).toString()    
// => "[object Object]"
 Many classes define more specific versions of the toString()
 method. The toString() method of the Array class, for example,
 converts each array element to a string and joins the resulting strings
 together with commas in between. The toString() method of the
 Function class converts user-defined functions to strings of JavaScript
 source code. The Date class defines a toString() method that
 returns a human-readable (and JavaScript-parsable) date and time
 string. The RegExp class defines a toString() method that
 converts RegExp objects to a string that looks like a RegExp literal:
 [1,2,3].toString()                  
// => "1,2,3"
 (function(x) { f(x); }).toString()  // => "function(x) { 
f(x); }"
 /\d+/g.toString()                   
// => "/\\d+/g"
 let d = new Date(2020,0,1);
 d.toString()  // => "Wed Jan 01 2020 00:00:00 GMT-0800 
(Pacific Standard Time)"
The other object conversion function is called valueOf(). The job of
 this method is less well defined: it is supposed to convert an object to a
 primitive value that represents the object, if any such primitive value
 exists. Objects are compound values, and most objects cannot really be
 represented by a single primitive value, so the default valueOf()
 method simply returns the object itself rather than returning a
 primitive. Wrapper classes such as String, Number, and Boolean define
 valueOf() methods that simply return the wrapped primitive value.
 Arrays, functions, and regular expressions simply inherit the default
 method. Calling valueOf() for instances of these types simply
 returns the object itself. The Date class defines a valueOf() method
 that returns the date in its internal representation: the number of
 milliseconds since January 1, 1970:
 let d = new Date(2010, 0, 1);   // January 1, 2010, (Pacific 
time)
 d.valueOf()                     
// => 1262332800000
 OBJECT-TO-PRIMITIVE CONVERSION ALGORITHMS
 With the toString() and valueOf() methods explained, we can
 now explain approximately how the three object-to-primitive
 algorithms work (the complete details are deferred until 
§14.4.7):
 The prefer-string algorithm first tries the toString()
 method. If the method is defined and returns a primitive value,
 then JavaScript uses that primitive value (even if it is not a
 string!). If toString() does not exist or if it returns an
 object, then JavaScript tries the valueOf() method. If that
 method exists and returns a primitive value, then JavaScript
 uses that value. Otherwise, the conversion fails with a
TypeError.
 The prefer-number algorithm works like the prefer-string
 algorithm, except that it tries valueOf() first and
 toString() second.
 The no-preference algorithm depends on the class of the
 object being converted. If the object is a Date object, then
 JavaScript uses the prefer-string algorithm. For any other
 object, JavaScript uses the prefer-number algorithm.
 The rules described here are true for all built-in JavaScript types and
 are the default rules for any classes you define yourself. 
§14.4.7
 explains how you can define your own object-to-primitive conversion
 algorithms for the classes you define.
 Before we leave this topic, it is worth noting that the details of the
 prefer-number conversion explain why empty arrays convert to the
 number 0 and single-element arrays can also convert to numbers:
 Number([])    
// => 0: this is unexpected!
 Number([99])  // => 99: really?
 The object-to-number conversion first converts the object to a primitive
 using the prefer-number algorithm, then converts the resulting
 primitive value to a number. The prefer-number algorithm tries
 valueOf() first and then falls back on toString(). But the Array
 class inherits the default valueOf() method, which does not return a
 primitive value. So when we try to convert an array to a number, we
 end up invoking the toString() method of the array. Empty arrays
 convert to the empty string. And the empty string converts to the
 number 0. An array with a single element converts to the same string
that that one element does. If an array contains a single number, that
 number is converted to a string, and then back to a number */
