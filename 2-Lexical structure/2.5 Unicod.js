/* 2.5 Unicode
 JavaScript programs are written using the Unicode character set, and
 you can use any Unicode characters in strings and comments. For
 portability and ease of editing, it is common to use only ASCII letters
 and digits in identifiers. But this is a programming convention only,
 and the language allows Unicode letters, digits, and ideographs (but not
 emojis) in identifiers. This means that programmers can use
 mathematical symbols and words from non-English languages as
 constants and variables:
 const π = 3.14;
 const sí = true;*/
