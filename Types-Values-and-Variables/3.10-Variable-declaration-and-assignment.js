/** 3.10 Variable Declaration and Assignment
 One of the most fundamental techniques of computer programming is
 the use of names—or identifiers—to represent values. Binding a name
 to a value gives us a way to refer to that value and use it in the
 programs we write. When we do this, we typically say that we are
 assigning a value to a variable. The term “variable” implies that new
 values can be assigned: that the value associated with the variable may
 vary as our program runs. If we permanently assign a value to a name,
 then we call that name a constant instead of a variable.
 Before you can use a variable or constant in a JavaScript program, you
 must declare it. In ES6 and later, this is done with the let and const
 keywords, which we explain next. Prior to ES6, variables were
 declared with var, which is more idiosyncratic and is explained later
