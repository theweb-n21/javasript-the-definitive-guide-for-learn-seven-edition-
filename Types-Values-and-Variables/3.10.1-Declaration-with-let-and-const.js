/** 3.10.1 Declarations with let and const
 In modern JavaScript (ES6 and later), variables are declared with the
 let keyword, like this:
 let i;
 let sum;
 You can also declare multiple variables in a single let statement:
let i, sum;
 It is a good programming practice to assign an initial value to your
 variables when you declare them, when this is possible:
 let message = "hello";
 let i = 0, j = 0, k = 0;
 let x = 2, y = x*x; // Initializers can use previously 
declared variables
 If you don’t specify an initial value for a variable with the let
 statement, the variable is declared, but its value is undefined until
 your code assigns a value to it.
 To declare a constant instead of a variable, use const instead of let.
 const works just like let except that you must initialize the constant
 when you declare it:
 const H0 = 74;         // Hubble constant (km/s/Mpc)
 const C = 299792.458;  // Speed of light in a vacuum (km/s)
 const AU = 1.496E8;    // Astronomical Unit: distance to the 
sun (km)
 As the name implies, constants cannot have their values changed, and
 any attempt to do so causes a TypeError to be thrown.
 It is a common (but not universal) convention to declare constants
 using names with all capital letters such as H0 or HTTP_NOT_FOUND
 as a way to distinguish them from variables.
 WHEN TO USE CONST
There are two schools of thought about the use of the const keyword. One
 approach is to use const only for values that are fundamentally unchanging, like
 the physical constants shown, or program version numbers, or byte sequences
 used to identify file types, for example. Another approach recognizes that many of
 the so-called variables in our program don’t actually ever change as our program
 runs. In this approach, we declare everything with const, and then if we find that
 we do actually want to allow the value to vary, we switch the declaration to let.
 This may help prevent bugs by ruling out accidental changes to variables that we
 did not intend.
 In one approach, we use const only for values that must not change. In the other,
 we use const for any value that does not happen to change. I prefer the former
 approach in my own code.
 In Chapter 5, we’ll learn about the for, for/in, and for/of loop
 statements in JavaScript. Each of these loops includes a loop variable
 that gets a new value assigned to it on each iteration of the loop.
 JavaScript allows us to declare the loop variable as part of the loop
 syntax itself, and this is another common way to use let:
 for(let i = 0, len = data.length; i < len; i++) 
console.log(data[i]);
 for(let datum of data) console.log(datum);
 for(let property in object) console.log(property);
 It may seem surprising, but you can also use const to declare the loop
 “variables” for for/in and for/of loops, as long as the body of the
 loop does not reassign a new value. In this case, the const declaration
 is just saying that the value is constant for the duration of one loop
 iteration:
 for(const datum of data) console.log(datum);
for(const property in object) console.log(property);
 VARIABLE AND CONSTANT SCOPE
 The scope of a variable is the region of your program source code in
 which it is defined. Variables and constants declared with let and
 const are block scoped. This means that they are only defined within
 the block of code in which the let or const statement appears.
 JavaScript class and function definitions are blocks, and so are the
 bodies of if/else statements, while loops, for loops, and so on.
 Roughly speaking, if a variable or constant is declared within a set of
 curly braces, then those curly braces delimit the region of code in
 which the variable or constant is defined (though of course it is not
 legal to reference a variable or constant from lines of code that execute
 before the let or const statement that declares the variable).
 Variables and constants declared as part of a for, for/in, or
 for/of loop have the loop body as their scope, even though they
 technically appear outside of the curly braces.
 When a declaration appears at the top level, outside of any code blocks,
 we say it is a global variable or constant and has global scope. In Node
 and in client-side JavaScript modules (see 
Chapter 10), the scope of a
 global variable is the file that it is defined in. In traditional client-side
 JavaScript, however, the scope of a global variable is the HTML
 document in which it is defined. That is: if one <script> declares a
 global variable or constant, that variable or constant is defined in all of
 the <script> elements in that document (or at least all of the scripts
 that execute after the let or const statement executes).
REPEATED DECLARATIONS
 It is a syntax error to use the same name with more than one let or
 const declaration in the same scope. It is legal (though a practice best
 avoided) to declare a new variable with the same name in a nested
 scope:
 const x = 1;        
if (x === 1) {
 let x = 2;      
// Declare x as a global constant
 // Inside a block x can refer to a 
different value
 console.log(x); // Prints 2
 }
 console.log(x);     
scope now
 let x = 3;          
// Prints 1: we're back in the global 
// ERROR! Syntax error trying to re
declare x
 DECLARATIONS AND TYPES
 2
 If you’re used to statically typed languages such as C or Java, you may
 think that the primary purpose of variable declarations is to specify the
 type of values that may be assigned to a variable. But, as you have
 seen, there is no type associated with JavaScript’s variable
 declarations. A JavaScript variable can hold a value of any type. For
 example, it is perfectly legal (but generally poor programming style) in
 JavaScript to assign a number to a variable and then later assign a
 string to that variable:
 let i = 10;
 i = "ten"; */
