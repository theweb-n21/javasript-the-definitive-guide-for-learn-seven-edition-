/* 3.2.6 Dates and Times
 JavaScript defines a simple Date class for representing and
 manipulating the numbers that represent dates and times. JavaScript
 Dates are objects, but they also have a numeric representation as a
timestamp that specifies the number of elapsed milliseconds since
 January 1, 1970:
 let timestamp = Date.now();  // The current time as a 
timestamp (a number).
 let now = new Date();        
object.
 let ms = now.getTime();      
// The current time as a Date 
// Convert to a millisecond 
timestamp.
 let iso = now.toISOString(); // Convert to a string in 
standard format.
 The Date class and its methods are covered in detail in
