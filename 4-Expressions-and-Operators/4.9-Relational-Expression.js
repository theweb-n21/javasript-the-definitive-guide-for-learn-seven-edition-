/** 4.9 Relational Expressions
 This section describes JavaScript’s relational operators. These
 operators test for a relationship (such as “equals,” “less than,” or
 “property of”) between two values and return true or false
 depending on whether that relationship exists. Relational expressions
 always evaluate to a boolean value, and that value is often used to
 control the flow of program execution in if, while, and for
statements (see 
Chapter 5). The subsections that follow document the
 equality and inequality operators, the comparison operators, and
 JavaScript’s other two relational operators, in and instanceof */
