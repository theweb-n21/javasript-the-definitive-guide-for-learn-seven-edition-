/** 4.5 Invocation Expressions
 An invocation expression is JavaScript’s syntax for calling (or
 executing) a function or method. It starts with a function expression
 that identifies the function to be called. The function expression is
 followed by an open parenthesis, a comma-separated list of zero or
 more argument expressions, and a close parenthesis. Some examples:
 f(0)            
// f is the function expression; 0 is the 
argument expression.
 Math.max(x,y,z) // Math.max is the function; x, y, and z are 
the arguments.
 a.sort()        
arguments.
 // a.sort is the function; there are no 
When an invocation expression is evaluated, the function expression is
 evaluated first, and then the argument expressions are evaluated to
 produce a list of argument values. If the value of the function
 expression is not a function, a TypeError is thrown. Next, the argument
 values are assigned, in order, to the parameter names specified when
 the function was defined, and then the body of the function is executed.
 If the function uses a return statement to return a value, then that
 value becomes the value of the invocation expression. Otherwise, the
 value of the invocation expression is undefined. Complete details
 on function invocation, including an explanation of what happens when
 the number of argument expressions does not match the number of
 parameters in the function definition, are in 
Chapter 8.
Every invocation expression includes a pair of parentheses and an
 expression before the open parenthesis. If that expression is a property
 access expression, then the invocation is known as a method
 invocation. In method invocations, the object or array that is the subject
 of the property access becomes the value of the this keyword while
 the body of the function is being executed. This enables an object
oriented programming paradigm in which functions (which we call
 “methods” when used this way) operate on the object of which they are
 part. See 
Chapter 9 for details. */
