/** 4.4 Property Access Expressions
 A property access expression evaluates to the value of an object
 property or an array element. JavaScript defines two syntaxes for
 property access:
 expression . identifier
 expression [ expression ]
 The first style of property access is an expression followed by a period
 and an identifier. The expression specifies the object, and the identifier
 specifies the name of the desired property. The second style of property
 access follows the first expression (the object or array) with another
 expression in square brackets. This second expression specifies the
 name of the desired property or the index of the desired array element.
 Here are some concrete examples:
 let o = {x: 1, y: {z: 3}}; // An example object
 let a = [o, 4, [5, 6]];    // An example array that contains 
the object
 o.x                        
// => 1: property x of expression 
o
 o.y.z                      
o.y
 o["x"]                     
a[1]                       
expression a
 a[2]["1"]                  
// => 3: property z of expression 
// => 1: property x of object o
 // => 4: element at index 1 of 
// => 6: element at index 1 of 
expression a[2]
a[0].x                     
a[0]
 // => 1: property x of expression 
With either type of property access expression, the expression before
 the . or [ is first evaluated. If the value is null or undefined, the
 expression throws a TypeError, since these are the two JavaScript
 values that cannot have properties. If the object expression is followed
 by a dot and an identifier, the value of the property named by that
 identifier is looked up and becomes the overall value of the expression.
 If the object expression is followed by another expression in square
 brackets, that second expression is evaluated and converted to a string.
 The overall value of the expression is then the value of the property
 named by that string. In either case, if the named property does not
 exist, then the value of the property access expression is undefined.
 The .identifier syntax is the simpler of the two property access options,
 but notice that it can only be used when the property you want to
 access has a name that is a legal identifier, and when you know the
 name when you write the program. If the property name includes
 spaces or punctuation characters, or when it is a number (for arrays),
 you must use the square bracket notation. Square brackets are also used
 when the property name is not static but is itself the result of a
 computation (see 
ยง6.3.1 for an example).
 Objects and their properties are covered in detail in 
arrays and their elements are covered in
