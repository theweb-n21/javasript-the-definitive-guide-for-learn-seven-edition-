/** 4.9.2 Comparison Operators
 The comparison operators test the relative order (numerical or
 alphabetical) of their two operands:
 Less than (<)
 The < operator evaluates to true if its first operand is less than its
 second operand; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
 Greater than (>)
 The > operator evaluates to true if its first operand is greater than
 its second operand; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
Less than or equal (<=)
 The <= operator evaluates to true if its first operand is less than
 or equal to its second operand; otherwise, it evaluates to false.
 Greater than or equal (>=)
 The >= operator evaluates to true if its first operand is greater
 than or equal to its second operand; otherwise, it evaluates to
 false.
 The operands of these comparison operators may be of any type.
 Comparison can be performed only on numbers and strings, however,
 so operands that are not numbers or strings are converted.
 Comparison and conversion occur as follows:
 If either operand evaluates to an object, that object is
 converted to a primitive value, as described at the end of
 §3.9.3; if its valueOf() method returns a primitive value,
 that value is used. Otherwise, the return value of its
 toString() method is used.
 If, after any required object-to-primitive conversion, both
 operands are strings, the two strings are compared, using
 alphabetical order, where “alphabetical order” is defined by
 the numerical order of the 16-bit Unicode values that make up
 the strings.
 If, after object-to-primitive conversion, at least one operand is
 not a string, both operands are converted to numbers and
 compared numerically. 0 and -0 are considered equal.
 Infinity is larger than any number other than itself, and 
Infinity is smaller than any number other than itself. If
 either operand is (or converts to) NaN, then the comparison
operator always returns false. Although the arithmetic
 operators do not allow BigInt values to be mixed with regular
 numbers, the comparison operators do allow comparisons
 between numbers and BigInts.
 Remember that JavaScript strings are sequences of 16-bit integer
 values, and that string comparison is just a numerical comparison of
 the values in the two strings. The numerical encoding order defined by
 Unicode may not match the traditional collation order used in any
 particular language or locale. Note in particular that string comparison
 is case-sensitive, and all capital ASCII letters are “less than” all
 lowercase ASCII letters. This rule can cause confusing results if you do
 not expect it. For example, according to the < operator, the string
 “Zoo” comes before the string “aardvark”.
 For a more robust string-comparison algorithm, try the
 String.localeCompare() method, which also takes locale
specific definitions of alphabetical order into account. For case
insensitive comparisons, you can convert the strings to all lowercase or
 all uppercase using String.toLowerCase() or
 String.toUpperCase(). And, for a more general and better
 localized string comparison tool, use the Intl.Collator class described in
 §11.7.3.
 Both the + operator and the comparison operators behave differently
 for numeric and string operands. + favors strings: it performs
 concatenation if either operand is a string. The comparison operators
 favor numbers and only perform string comparison if both operands are
 strings:
1 + 2        
"1" + "2"    
"1" + 2      
11 < 3       
// => 3: addition.
 // => "12": concatenation.
 // => "12": 2 is converted to "2".
 // => false: numeric comparison.
 "11" < "3"   // => true: string comparison.
 "11" < 3     
// => false: numeric comparison, "11" converted 
to 11.
 "one" < 3    
to NaN.
 // => false: numeric comparison, "one" converted 
Finally, note that the <= (less than or equal) and >= (greater than or
 equal) operators do not rely on the equality or strict equality operators
 for determining whether two values are “equal.” Instead, the less-than
or-equal operator is simply defined as “not greater than,” and the
 greater-than-or-equal operator is defined as “not less than.” The one
 exception occurs when either operand is (or converts to) NaN, in which
 case, all four comparison operators return false. */
