/** 4.8 Arithmetic Expressions
 This section covers the operators that perform arithmetic or other
 numerical manipulations on their operands. The exponentiation,
 multiplication, division, and subtraction operators are straightforward
and are covered first. The addition operator gets a subsection of its own
 because it can also perform string concatenation and has some unusual
 type conversion rules. The unary operators and the bitwise operators
 are also covered in subsections of their own.
 Most of these arithmetic operators (except as noted as follows) can be
 used with BigInt (see 
§3.2.5) operands or with regular numbers, as
 long as you don’t mix the two types.
 The basic arithmetic operators are ** (exponentiation), *
 (multiplication), / (division), % (modulo: remainder after division), +
 (addition), and - (subtraction). As noted, we’ll discuss the + operator
 in a section of its own. The other five basic operators simply evaluate
 their operands, convert the values to numbers if necessary, and then
 compute the power, product, quotient, remainder, or difference. Non
numeric operands that cannot convert to numbers convert to the NaN
 value. If either operand is (or converts to) NaN, the result of the
 operation is (almost always) NaN.
 The ** operator has higher precedence than *, /, and % (which in turn
 have higher precedence than + and -). Unlike the other operators, **
 works right-to-left, so 2**2**3 is the same as 2**8, not 4**3.
 There is a natural ambiguity to expressions like -3**2. Depending on
 the relative precedence of unary minus and exponentiation, that
 expression could mean (-3)**2 or -(3**2). Different languages
 handle this differently, and rather than pick sides, JavaScript simply
 makes it a syntax error to omit parentheses in this case, forcing you to
 write an unambiguous expression. ** is JavaScript’s newest arithmetic
operator: it was added to the language with ES2016. The
 Math.pow() function has been available since the earliest versions
 of JavaScript, however, and it performs exactly the same operation as
 the ** operator.
 The / operator divides its first operand by its second. If you are used to
 programming languages that distinguish between integer and floating
point numbers, you might expect to get an integer result when you
 divide one integer by another. In JavaScript, however, all numbers are
 floating-point, so all division operations have floating-point results:
 5/2 evaluates to 2.5, not 2. Division by zero yields positive or
 negative infinity, while 0/0 evaluates to NaN: neither of these cases
 raises an error.
 The % operator computes the first operand modulo the second operand.
 In other words, it returns the remainder after whole-number division of
 the first operand by the second operand. The sign of the result is the
 same as the sign of the first operand. For example, 5 % 2 evaluates to
 1, and -5 % 2 evaluates to -1.
 While the modulo operator is typically used with integer operands, it
 also works for floating-point values. For example, 6.5 % 2.1
 evaluates to 0.2 */
