/** 4.4.1 Conditional Property Access
 Chapter 6, and
 ES2020 adds two new kinds of property access expressions:
expression ?. identifier
 expression ?.[ expression ]
 In JavaScript, the values null and undefined are the only two
 values that do not have properties. In a regular property access
 expression using . or [], you get a TypeError if the expression on the
 left evaluates to null or undefined. You can use ?. and ?.[]
 syntax to guard against errors of this type.
 Consider the expression a?.b. If a is null or undefined, then the
 expression evaluates to undefined without any attempt to access the
 property b. If a is some other value, then a?.b evaluates to whatever
 a.b would evaluate to (and if a does not have a property named b,
 then the value will again be undefined).
 This form of property access expression is sometimes called “optional
 chaining” because it also works for longer “chained” property access
 expressions like this one:
 let a = { b: null };
 a.b?.c.d   // => undefined
 a is an object, so a.b is a valid property access expression. But the
 value of a.b is null, so a.b.c would throw a TypeError. By using
 ?. instead of . we avoid the TypeError, and a.b?.c evaluates to
 undefined. This means that (a.b?.c).d will throw a TypeError,
 because that expression attempts to access a property of the value
 undefined. But—and this is a very important part of “optional
 chaining”—a.b?.c.d (without the parentheses) simply evaluates to
undefined and does not throw an error. This is because property
 access with ?. is “short-circuiting”: if the subexpression to the left of
 ?. evaluates to null or undefined, then the entire expression
 immediately evaluates to undefined without any further property
 access attempts.
 Of course, if a.b is an object, and if that object has no property named
 c, then a.b?.c.d will again throw a TypeError, and we will want to
 use another conditional property access:
 let a = { b: {} };
 a.b?.c?.d  // => undefined
 Conditional property access is also possible using ?.[] instead of [].
 In the expression a?.[b][c], if the value of a is null or
 undefined, then the entire expression immediately evaluates to
 undefined, and subexpressions b and c are never even evaluated. If
 either of those expressions has side effects, the side effect will not
 occur if a is not defined:
 let a;          
// Oops, we forgot to initialize this 
variable!
 let index = 0;
 try {
 a[index++]; // Throws TypeError
 } catch(e) {
 index       
thrown
 }
 a?.[index++]    
index           
circuits
 // => 1: increment occurs before TypeError is 
// => undefined: because a is undefined
 // => 1: not incremented because ?.[] short
a[index++]      
// !TypeError: can't index undefined.
Conditional property access with ?. and ?.[] is one of the newest
 features of JavaScript. As of early 2020, this new syntax is supported
 in the current or beta versions of most major browsers */
