/** The operators listed in 
Table 4-1 are arranged in order from high
 precedence to low precedence, with horizontal lines separating groups
 of operators at the same precedence level. Operator precedence
 controls the order in which operations are performed. Operators with
 higher precedence (nearer the top of the table) are performed before
 those with lower precedence (nearer to the bottom).
 Consider the following expression:
 w = x + y*z;
 The multiplication operator * has a higher precedence than the addition
 operator +, so the multiplication is performed before the addition.
 Furthermore, the assignment operator = has the lowest precedence, so
 the assignment is performed after all the operations on the right side
 are completed.
 Operator precedence can be overridden with the explicit use of
 parentheses. To force the addition in the previous example to be
performed first, write:
 w = (x + y)*z;
 Note that property access and invocation expressions have higher
 precedence than any of the operators listed in 
Table 4-1. Consider this
 expression:
 // my is an object with a property named functions whose 
value is an
 // array of functions. We invoke function number x, passing 
it argument
 // y, and then we ask for the type of the value returned.
 typeof my.functions[x](y)
 Although typeof is one of the highest-priority operators, the
 typeof operation is performed on the result of the property access,
 array index, and function invocation, all of which have higher priority
 than operators.
 In practice, if you are at all unsure about the precedence of your
 operators, the simplest thing to do is to use parentheses to make the
 evaluation order explicit. The rules that are important to know are
 these: multiplication and division are performed before addition and
 subtraction, and assignment has very low precedence and is almost
 always performed last.
 When new operators are added to JavaScript, they do not always fit
 naturally into this precedence scheme. The ?? operator (
 ยง4.13.2) is
 shown in the table as lower-precedence than || and &&, but, in fact, its
 precedence relative to those operators is not defined, and ES2020
 requires you to explicitly use parentheses if you mix ?? with either ||
or &&. Similarly, the new ** exponentiation operator does not have a
 well-defined precedence relative to the unary negation operator, and
 you must use parentheses when combining negation with
 exponentiation */
