/** 4.5.1 Conditional Invocation
 In ES2020, you can also invoke a function using ?.() instead of ().
 Normally when you invoke a function, if the expression to the left of
 the parentheses is null or undefined or any other non-function, a
 TypeError is thrown. With the new ?.() invocation syntax, if the
 expression to the left of the ?. evaluates to null or undefined,
 then the entire invocation expression evaluates to undefined and no
 exception is thrown.
 Array objects have a sort() method that can optionally be passed a
 function argument that defines the desired sorting order for the array
 elements. Before ES2020, if you wanted to write a method like
 sort() that takes an optional function argument, you would typically
 use an if statement to check that the function argument was defined
 before invoking it in the body of the if:
 function square(x, log) { // The second argument is an 
optional function
    if (log) {            // If the optional function is 
passed
        log(x);           // Invoke it
    }
    return x * x;         // Return the square of the 
argument
 }
 With this conditional invocation syntax of ES2020, however, you can
 simply write the function invocation using ?.(), knowing that
 invocation will only happen if there is actually a value to be invoked:
 function square(x, log) { // The second argument is an 
optional function
    log?.(x);             // Call the function if there is 
one
    return x * x;         // Return the square of the 
argument
 }
 Note, however, that ?.() only checks whether the lefthand side is
 null or undefined. It does not verify that the value is actually a
 function. So the square() function in this example would still throw
 an exception if you passed two numbers to it, for example.
 Like conditional property access expressions (ยง4.4.1), function
 invocation with ?.() is short-circuiting: if the value to the left of ?.
 is null or undefined, then none of the argument expressions
 within the parentheses are evaluated:
 let f = null, x = 0;
 try {
    f(x++); // Throws TypeError because f is null
 } catch(e) {
x       
is thrown
 }
 f?.(x++)    
thrown
 x           
circuiting
 // => 1: x gets incremented before the exception 
// => undefined: f is null, but no exception 
// => 1: increment is skipped because of short
Conditional invocation expressions with ?.() work just as well for
 methods as they do for functions. But because method invocation also
 involves property access, it is worth taking a moment to be sure you
 understand the differences between the following expressions:
 o.m()     
o?.m()    
// Regular property access, regular invocation
 // Conditional property access, regular invocation
 o.m?.()   // Regular property access, conditional invocation
 In the first expression, o must be an object with a property m and the
 value of that property must be a function. In the second expression, if o
 is null or undefined, then the expression evaluates to
 undefined. But if o has any other value, then it must have a
 property m whose value is a function. And in the third expression, o
 must not be null or undefined. If it does not have a property m, or
 if the value of that property is null, then the entire expression
 evaluates to undefined.
 Conditional invocation with ?.() is one of the newest features of
 JavaScript. As of the first months of 2020, this new syntax is supported
 in the current or beta versions of most major browsers */
