/** 4.7.6 Order of Evaluation
 Operator precedence and associativity specify the order in which
 operations are performed in a complex expression, but they do not
 specify the order in which the subexpressions are evaluated. JavaScript
 always evaluates expressions in strictly left-to-right order. In the
 expression w = x + y * z, for example, the subexpression w is
 evaluated first, followed by x, y, and z. Then the values of y and z are
 multiplied, added to the value of x, and assigned to the variable or
 property specified by expression w. Adding parentheses to the
 expressions can change the relative order of the multiplication,
 addition, and assignment, but not the left-to-right order of evaluation.
 Order of evaluation only makes a difference if any of the expressions
 being evaluated has side effects that affect the value of another
 expression. If expression x increments a variable that is used by
 expression z, then the fact that x is evaluated before z is important */
