/** 4.7 Operator Overview
 Operators are used for JavaScript’s arithmetic expressions, comparison
 expressions, logical expressions, assignment expressions, and more.
 Table 4-1 summarizes the operators and serves as a convenient
 reference.
 Note that most operators are represented by punctuation characters
 such as + and =. Some, however, are represented by keywords such as
 delete and instanceof. Keyword operators are regular operators,
 just like those expressed with punctuation; they simply have a less
 succinct syntax.
 Table 4-1 is organized by operator precedence. The operators listed
first have higher precedence than those listed last. Operators separated
 by a horizontal line have different precedence levels. The column
 labeled A gives the operator associativity, which can be L (left-to
right) or R (right-to-left), and the column N specifies the number of
 operands. The column labeled Types lists the expected types of the
 operands and (after the → symbol) the result type for the operator. The
 subsections that follow the table explain the concepts of precedence,
 associativity, and operand type. The operators themselves are
 individually documented following that discussion.
