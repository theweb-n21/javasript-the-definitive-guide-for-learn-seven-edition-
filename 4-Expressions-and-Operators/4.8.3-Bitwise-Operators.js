/** 4.8.3 Bitwise Operators
 The bitwise operators perform low-level manipulation of the bits in the
 binary representation of numbers. Although they do not perform
 traditional arithmetic operations, they are categorized as arithmetic
 operators here because they operate on numeric operands and return a
 numeric value. Four of these operators perform Boolean algebra on the
 individual bits of the operands, behaving as if each bit in each operand
were a boolean value (1=true, 0=false). The other three bitwise
 operators are used to shift bits left and right. These operators are not
 commonly used in JavaScript programming, and if you are not familiar
 with the binary representation of integers, including the two’s
 complement representation of negative integers, you can probably skip
 this section.
 The bitwise operators expect integer operands and behave as if those
 values were represented as 32-bit integers rather than 64-bit floating
point values. These operators convert their operands to numbers, if
 necessary, and then coerce the numeric values to 32-bit integers by
 dropping any fractional part and any bits beyond the 32nd. The shift
 operators require a right-side operand between 0 and 31. After
 converting this operand to an unsigned 32-bit integer, they drop any
 bits beyond the 5th, which yields a number in the appropriate range.
 Surprisingly, NaN, Infinity, and -Infinity all convert to 0
 when used as operands of these bitwise operators.
 All of these bitwise operators except >>> can be used with regular
 number operands or with BigInt (see 
§3.2.5) operands.
 Bitwise AND (&)
 The & operator performs a Boolean AND operation on each bit of
 its integer arguments. A bit is set in the result only if the
 corresponding bit is set in both operands. For example, 0x1234 &
 0x00FF evaluates to 0x0034.
 Bitwise OR (|)
 The | operator performs a Boolean OR operation on each bit of its
integer arguments. A bit is set in the result if the corresponding bit
 is set in one or both of the operands. For example, 0x1234 |
 0x00FF evaluates to 0x12FF.
 Bitwise XOR (^)
 The ^ operator performs a Boolean exclusive OR operation on each
 bit of its integer arguments. Exclusive OR means that either
 operand one is true or operand two is true, but not both. A bit is
 set in this operation’s result if a corresponding bit is set in one (but
 not both) of the two operands. For example, 0xFF00 ^ 0xF0F0
 evaluates to 0x0FF0.
 Bitwise NOT (~)
 The ~ operator is a unary operator that appears before its single
 integer operand. It operates by reversing all bits in the operand.
 Because of the way signed integers are represented in JavaScript,
 applying the ~ operator to a value is equivalent to changing its sign
 and subtracting 1. For example, ~0x0F evaluates to
 0xFFFFFFF0, or −16.
 Shift left (<<)
 The << operator moves all bits in its first operand to the left by the
 number of places specified in the second operand, which should be
 an integer between 0 and 31. For example, in the operation a <<
 1, the first bit (the ones bit) of a becomes the second bit (the twos
 bit), the second bit of a becomes the third, etc. A zero is used for
 the new first bit, and the value of the 32nd bit is lost. Shifting a
 value left by one position is equivalent to multiplying by 2, shifting
 two positions is equivalent to multiplying by 4, and so on. For
 example, 7 << 2 evaluates to 28.
 Shift right with sign (>>)
The >> operator moves all bits in its first operand to the right by
 the number of places specified in the second operand (an integer
 between 0 and 31). Bits that are shifted off the right are lost. The
 bits filled in on the left depend on the sign bit of the original
 operand, in order to preserve the sign of the result. If the first
 operand is positive, the result has zeros placed in the high bits; if
 the first operand is negative, the result has ones placed in the high
 bits. Shifting a positive value right one place is equivalent to
 dividing by 2 (discarding the remainder), shifting right two places
 is equivalent to integer division by 4, and so on. 7 >> 1 evaluates
 to 3, for example, but note that and −7 >> 1 evaluates to −4.
 Shift right with zero fill (>>>)
 The >>> operator is just like the >> operator, except that the bits
 shifted in on the left are always zero, regardless of the sign of the
 first operand. This is useful when you want to treat signed 32-bit
 values as if they are unsigned integers. −1 >> 4 evaluates to −1,
 but −1 >>> 4 evaluates to 0x0FFFFFFF, for example. This is
 the only one of the JavaScript bitwise operators that cannot be used
 with BigInt values. BigInt does not represent negative numbers by
 setting the high bit the way that 32-bit integers do, and this operator
 only makes sense for that particular two’s complement
 representation. */
