/** 4.2 Object and Array Initializers
 Object and array initializers are expressions whose value is a newly
 created object or array. These initializer expressions are sometimes
 called object literals and array literals. Unlike true literals, however,
 they are not primary expressions, because they include a number of
 subexpressions that specify property and element values. Array
 initializers have a slightly simpler syntax, and we’ll begin with those.
 An array initializer is a comma-separated list of expressions contained
 within square brackets. The value of an array initializer is a newly
created array. The elements of this new array are initialized to the
 values of the comma-separated expressions:
 []         
// An empty array: no expressions inside brackets 
means no elements
 [1+2,3+4]  // A 2-element array.  First element is 3, second 
is 7
 The element expressions in an array initializer can themselves be array
 initializers, which means that these expressions can create nested
 arrays:
 let matrix = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]];
 The element expressions in an array initializer are evaluated each time
 the array initializer is evaluated. This means that the value of an array
 initializer expression may be different each time it is evaluated.
 Undefined elements can be included in an array literal by simply
 omitting a value between commas. For example, the following array
 contains five elements, including three undefined elements:
 let sparseArray = [1,,,,5];
 A single trailing comma is allowed after the last expression in an array
 initializer and does not create an undefined element. However, any
 array access expression for an index after that of the last expression
 will necessarily evaluate to undefined.
 Object initializer expressions are like array initializer expressions, but
 the square brackets are replaced by curly brackets, and each
 subexpression is prefixed with a property name and a colon:
let p = { x: 2.3, y: -1.2 };  // An object with 2 properties
 let q = {};                   
properties
 q.x = 2.3; q.y = -1.2;        
// An empty object with no 
// Now q has the same 
properties as p
 In ES6, object literals have a much more feature-rich syntax (you can
 find details in 
§6.10). Object literals can be nested. For example:
 let rectangle = {
 upperLeft: { x: 2, y: 2 },
 lowerRight: { x: 4, y: 5 }
 };
 We’ll see object and array initializers again in Chapters 
6 and  */
