 /** 4.8.2 Unary Arithmetic Operators
 Unary operators modify the value of a single operand to produce a new
 value. In JavaScript, the unary operators all have high precedence and
 are all right-associative. The arithmetic unary operators described in
 this section (+, -, ++, and --) all convert their single operand to a
 number, if necessary. Note that the punctuation characters + and - are
 used as both unary and binary operators.
The unary arithmetic operators are the following:
 Unary plus (+)
 The unary plus operator converts its operand to a number (or to
 NaN) and returns that converted value. When used with an operand
 that is already a number, it doesn’t do anything. This operator may
 not be used with BigInt values, since they cannot be converted to
 regular numbers.
 Unary minus (-)
 When - is used as a unary operator, it converts its operand to a
 number, if necessary, and then changes the sign of the result.
 Increment (++)
 The ++ operator increments (i.e., adds 1 to) its single operand,
 which must be an lvalue (a variable, an element of an array, or a
 property of an object). The operator converts its operand to a
 number, adds 1 to that number, and assigns the incremented value
 back into the variable, element, or property.
 The return value of the ++ operator depends on its position relative
 to the operand. When used before the operand, where it is known as
 the pre-increment operator, it increments the operand and evaluates
 to the incremented value of that operand. When used after the
 operand, where it is known as the post-increment operator, it
 increments its operand but evaluates to the unincremented value of
 that operand. Consider the difference between these two lines of
 code:
 let i = 1, j = ++i;    // i and j are both 2
 let n = 1, m = n++;    // n is 2, m is 1
Note that the expression x++ is not always the same as x=x+1.
 The ++ operator never performs string concatenation: it always
 converts its operand to a number and increments it. If x is the string
 “1”, ++x is the number 2, but x+1 is the string “11”.
 Also note that, because of JavaScript’s automatic semicolon
 insertion, you cannot insert a line break between the post-increment
 operator and the operand that precedes it. If you do so, JavaScript
 will treat the operand as a complete statement by itself and insert a
 semicolon before it.
 §5.4.3).
 This operator, in both its pre- and post-increment forms, is most
 commonly used to increment a counter that controls a for loop
 (
 Decrement (--)
 The -- operator expects an lvalue operand. It converts the value of
 the operand to a number, subtracts 1, and assigns the decremented
 value back to the operand. Like the ++ operator, the return value of-- depends on its position relative to the operand. When used
 before the operand, it decrements and returns the decremented
 value. When used after the operand, it decrements the operand but
 returns the undecremented value. When used after its operand, no
 line break is allowed between the operand and the operator */
