/** 4.8.1 The + Operator
 The binary + operator adds numeric operands or concatenates string
 operands:
1 + 2                        
"hello" + " " + "there"      
"1" + "2"                    
// => 3
 // => "hello there"
 // => "12"
 When the values of both operands are numbers, or are both strings,
 then it is obvious what the + operator does. In any other case, however,
 type conversion is necessary, and the operation to be performed
 depends on the conversion performed. The conversion rules for + give
 priority to string concatenation: if either of the operands is a string or
 an object that converts to a string, the other operand is converted to a
 string and concatenation is performed. Addition is performed only if
 neither operand is string-like.
 Technically, the + operator behaves like this:
 If either of its operand values is an object, it converts it to a
 primitive using the object-to-primitive algorithm described in
 ยง3.9.3. Date objects are converted by their toString()
 method, and all other objects are converted via valueOf(),
 if that method returns a primitive value. However, most
 objects do not have a useful valueOf() method, so they are
 converted via toString() as well.
 After object-to-primitive conversion, if either operand is a
 string, the other is converted to a string and concatenation is
 performed.
 Otherwise, both operands are converted to numbers (or to
 NaN) and addition is performed.
 Here are some examples:
 1 + 2         
"1" + "2"     
"1" + 2       
// => 3: addition
 // => "12": concatenation
 // => "12": concatenation after number-to
string
 1 + {}        
// => "1[object Object]": concatenation after 
object-to-string
 true + true   // => 2: addition after boolean-to-number
 2 + null      
// => 2: addition after null converts to 0
 2 + undefined // => NaN: addition after undefined converts to 
NaN
 Finally, it is important to note that when the + operator is used with
 strings and numbers, it may not be associative. That is, the result may
 depend on the order in which operations are performed.
 For example:
 1 + 2 + " blind mice"    // => "3 blind mice"
 1 + (2 + " blind mice")  // => "12 blind mice"
 The first line has no parentheses, and the + operator has left-to-right
 associativity, so the two numbers are added first, and their sum is
 concatenated with the string. In the second line, parentheses alter this
 order of operations: the number 2 is concatenated with the string to
 produce a new string. Then the number 1 is concatenated with the new
 string to produce the final result */
