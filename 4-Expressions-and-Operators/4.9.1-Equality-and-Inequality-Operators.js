/** 4.9.1 Equality and Inequality Operators
 The == and === operators check whether two values are the same,
 using two different definitions of sameness. Both operators accept
 operands of any type, and both return true if their operands are the
 same and false if they are different. The === operator is known as
 the strict equality operator (or sometimes the identity operator), and it
 checks whether its two operands are “identical” using a strict definition
 of sameness. The == operator is known as the equality operator; it
 checks whether its two operands are “equal” using a more relaxed
 definition of sameness that allows type conversions.
 The != and !== operators test for the exact opposite of the == and
 === operators. The != inequality operator returns false if two
 values are equal to each other according to == and returns true
 otherwise. The !== operator returns false if two values are strictly
 equal to each other and returns true otherwise. As you’ll see in 
§4.10,
 the ! operator computes the Boolean NOT operation. This makes it
 easy to remember that != and !== stand for “not equal to” and “not
 strictly equal to.”
 THE =, ==, AND === OPERATORS
 JavaScript supports =, ==, and === operators. Be sure you understand the differences between these
 assignment, equality, and strict equality operators, and be careful to use the correct one when coding!
 Although it is tempting to read all three operators as “equals,” it may help to reduce confusion if you
read “gets” or “is assigned” for =, “is equal to” for ==, and “is strictly equal to” for ===.
 The == operator is a legacy feature of JavaScript and is widely considered to be a source of bugs.
 You should almost always use === instead of ==, and !== instead of !=.
 As mentioned in 
§3.8, JavaScript objects are compared by reference,
 not by value. An object is equal to itself, but not to any other object. If
 two distinct objects have the same number of properties, with the same
 names and values, they are still not equal. Similarly, two arrays that
 have the same elements in the same order are not equal to each other.
 STRICT EQUALITY
 The strict equality operator === evaluates its operands, then compares
 the two values as follows, performing no type conversion:
 If the two values have different types, they are not equal.
 If both values are null or both values are undefined, they
 are equal.
 If both values are the boolean value true or both are the
 boolean value false, they are equal.
 If one or both values is NaN, they are not equal. (This is
 surprising, but the NaN value is never equal to any other
 value, including itself! To check whether a value x is NaN, use
 x !== x, or the global isNaN() function.)
 If both values are numbers and have the same value, they are
 equal. If one value is 0 and the other is -0, they are also
 equal.
 If both values are strings and contain exactly the same 16-bit
 values (see the sidebar in 
§3.3) in the same positions, they are
 equal. If the strings differ in length or content, they are not
equal. Two strings may have the same meaning and the same
 visual appearance, but still be encoded using different
 sequences of 16-bit values. JavaScript performs no Unicode
 normalization, and a pair of strings like this is not considered
 equal to the === or == operators.
 If both values refer to the same object, array, or function, they
 are equal. If they refer to different objects, they are not equal,
 even if both objects have identical properties.
 EQUALITY WITH TYPE CONVERSION
 The equality operator == is like the strict equality operator, but it is
 less strict. If the values of the two operands are not the same type, it
 attempts some type conversions and tries the comparison again:
 If the two values have the same type, test them for strict
 equality as described previously. If they are strictly equal, they
 are equal. If they are not strictly equal, they are not equal.
 If the two values do not have the same type, the == operator
 may still consider them equal. It uses the following rules and
 type conversions to check for equality:
 If one value is null and the other is undefined,
 they are equal.
 If one value is a number and the other is a string,
 convert the string to a number and try the comparison
 again, using the converted value.
 If either value is true, convert it to 1 and try the
 comparison again. If either value is false, convert it
 to 0 and try the comparison again.
 If one value is an object and the other is a number or
 string, convert the object to a primitive using the
algorithm described in 
§3.9.3 and try the comparison
 again. An object is converted to a primitive value by
 either its toString() method or its valueOf()
 method. The built-in classes of core JavaScript
 attempt valueOf() conversion before
 toString() conversion, except for the Date class,
 which performs toString() conversion.
 Any other combinations of values are not equal.
 As an example of testing for equality, consider the comparison:
 "1" == true  // => true
 This expression evaluates to true, indicating that these very different
looking values are in fact equal. The boolean value true is first
 converted to the number 1, and the comparison is done again. Next, the
 string "1" is converted to the number 1. Since both values are now the
 same, the comparison returns true. */
