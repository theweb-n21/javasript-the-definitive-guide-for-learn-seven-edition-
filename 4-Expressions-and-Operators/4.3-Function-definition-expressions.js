/**4.3 Function Definition Expressions
 7.
 A function definition expression defines a JavaScript function, and the
 value of such an expression is the newly defined function. In a sense, a
 function definition expression is a “function literal” in the same way
 that an object initializer is an “object literal.” A function definition
 expression typically consists of the keyword function followed by a
 comma-separated list of zero or more identifiers (the parameter names)
 in parentheses and a block of JavaScript code (the function body) in
 curly braces. For example:
 // This function returns the square of the value passed to 
it.
 let square = function(x) { return x * x; };
 A function definition expression can also include a name for the
function. Functions can also be defined using a function statement
 rather than a function expression. And in ES6 and later, function
 expressions can use a compact new “arrow function” syntax. Complete
 details on function definition are in
