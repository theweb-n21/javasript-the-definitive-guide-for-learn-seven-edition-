 /**3.10.3 Destructuring Assignment
 ES6 implements a kind of compound declaration and assignment
 syntax known as destructuring assignment. In a destructuring
 assignment, the value on the righthand side of the equals sign is an
 array or object (a “structured” value), and the lefthand side specifies
 one or more variable names using a syntax that mimics array and
 object literal syntax. When a destructuring assignment occurs, one or
 more values are extracted (“destructured”) from the value on the right
 and stored into the variables named on the left. Destructuring
 assignment is perhaps most commonly used to initialize variables as
 part of a const, let, or var declaration statement, but it can also be
 done in regular assignment expressions (with variables that have
 already been declared). And, as we’ll see in §8.3.5, destructuring can
 also be used when defining the parameters to a function.
 Here are simple destructuring assignments using arrays of values:
 let [x,y] = [1,2];  // Same as let x=1, y=2
 [x,y] = [x+1,y+1];  // Same as x = x + 1, y = y + 1
 [x,y] = [y,x];      // Swap the value of the two variables
 [x,y]               // => [3,2]: the incremented and swapped 
values
 Notice how destructuring assignment makes it easy to work with
 functions that return arrays of values:
 // Convert [x,y] coordinates to [r,theta] polar coordinates
 function toPolar(x, y) {
    return [Math.sqrt(x*x+y*y), Math.atan2(y,x)];
 }
 // Convert polar to Cartesian coordinates
function toCartesian(r, theta) {
 return [r*Math.cos(theta), r*Math.sin(theta)];
 }
 let [r,theta] = toPolar(1.0, 1.0);  // r == Math.sqrt(2); 
theta == Math.PI/4
 let [x,y] = toCartesian(r,theta);   // [x, y] == [1.0, 1,0]
 We saw that variables and constants can be declared as part of
 JavaScript’s various for loops. It is possible to use variable
 destructuring in this context as well. Here is a code that loops over the
 name/value pairs of all properties of an object and uses destructuring
 assignment to convert those pairs from two-element arrays into
 individual variables:
 let o = { x: 1, y: 2 }; // The object we'll loop over
 for(const [name, value] of Object.entries(o)) {
 console.log(name, value); // Prints "x 1" and "y 2"
 }
 The number of variables on the left of a destructuring assignment does
 not have to match the number of array elements on the right. Extra
 variables on the left are set to undefined, and extra values on the
 right are ignored. The list of variables on the left can include extra
 commas to skip certain values on the right:
 let [x,y] = [1];     
[x,y] = [1,2,3];     
// x == 1; y == undefined
 // x == 1; y == 2
 [,x,,y] = [1,2,3,4]; // x == 2; y == 4
 If you want to collect all unused or remaining values into a single
 variable when destructuring an array, use three dots (...) before the
 last variable name on the left-hand side:
let [x, ...y] = [1,2,3,4];  // y == [2,3,4]
 We’ll see three dots used this way again in 
§8.3.2, where they are used
 to indicate that all remaining function arguments should be collected
 into a single array.
 Destructuring assignment can be used with nested arrays. In this case,
 the lefthand side of the assignment should look like a nested array
 literal:
 let [a, [b, c]] = [1, [2,2.5], 3]; // a == 1; b == 2; c == 
2.5
 A powerful feature of array destructuring is that it does not actually
 require an array! You can use any iterable object (
 Chapter 12) on the
 righthand side of the assignment; any object that can be used with a
 for/of loop (
 §5.4.4) can also be destructured:
 let [first, ...rest] = "Hello"; // first == "H"; rest == 
["e","l","l","o"]
 Destructuring assignment can also be performed when the righthand
 side is an object value. In this case, the lefthand side of the assignment
 looks something like an object literal: a comma-separated list of
 variable names within curly braces:
 let transparent = {r: 0.0, g: 0.0, b: 0.0, a: 1.0}; // A RGBA 
color
 let {r, g, b} = transparent;  // r == 0.0; g == 0.0; b == 0.0
 The next example copies global functions of the Math object into
 variables, which might simplify code that does a lot of trigonometry:
// Same as const sin=Math.sin, cos=Math.cos, tan=Math.tan
 const {sin, cos, tan} = Math;
 Notice in the code here that the Math object has many properties other
 than the three that are destructured into individual variables. Those that
 are not named are simply ignored. If the lefthand side of this
 assignment had included a variable whose name was not a property of
 Math, that variable would simply be assigned undefined.
 In each of these object destructuring examples, we have chosen
 variable names that match the property names of the object we’re
 destructuring. This keeps the syntax simple and easy to understand, but
 it is not required. Each of the identifiers on the lefthand side of an
 object destructuring assignment can also be a colon-separated pair of
 identifiers, where the first is the name of the property whose value is to
 be assigned and the second is the name of the variable to assign it to:
 // Same as const cosine = Math.cos, tangent = Math.tan;
 const { cos: cosine, tan: tangent } = Math;
 I find that object destructuring syntax becomes too complicated to be
 useful when the variable names and property names are not the same,
 and I tend to avoid the shorthand in this case. If you choose to use it,
 remember that property names are always on the left of the colon, in
 both object literals and on the left of an object destructuring
 assignment.
 Destructuring assignment becomes even more complicated when it is
 used with nested objects, or arrays of objects, or objects of arrays, but
 it is legal:
let points = [{x: 1, y: 2}, {x: 3, y: 4}];     
two point objects
 let [{x: x1, y: y1}, {x: x2, y: y2}] = points; // 
destructured into 4 variables.
 (x1 === 1 && y1 === 2 && x2 === 3 && y2 === 4) // => true
 // An array of 
Or, instead of destructuring an array of objects, we could destructure an
 object of arrays:
 let points = { p1: [1,2], p2: [3,4] };         
// An object 
with 2 array props
 let { p1: [x1, y1], p2: [x2, y2] } = points;   // 
destructured into 4 vars
 (x1 === 1 && y1 === 2 && x2 === 3 && y2 === 4) // => true
 Complex destructuring syntax like this can be hard to write and hard to
 read, and you may be better off just writing out your assignments
 explicitly with traditional code like let x1 = points.p1[0];.
 UNDERSTANDING COMPLEX DESTRUCTURING
 If you find yourself working with code that uses complex destructuring assignments, there is a useful
 regularity that can help you make sense of the complex cases. Think first about a regular (single
value) assignment. After the assignment is done, you can take the variable name from the lefthand
 side of the assignment and use it as an expression in your code, where it will evaluate to whatever
 value you assigned it. The same thing is true for destructuring assignment. The lefthand side of a
 destructuring assignment looks like an array literal or an object literal (
 §6.10). After the
 assignment has been done, the lefthand side will actually work as a valid array literal or object literal
 elsewhere in your code. You can check that you’ve written a destructuring assignment correctly by
 trying to use the lefthand side on the righthand side of another assignment expression:
 §6.2.1 and 
// Start with a data structure and a complex destructuring
 let points = [{x: 1, y: 2}, {x: 3, y: 4}];
 let [{x: x1, y: y1}, {x: x2, y: y2}] = points;
 // Check your destructuring syntax by flipping the assignment around
 let points2 = [{x: x1, y: y1}, {x: x2, y: y2}]; // points2 */
