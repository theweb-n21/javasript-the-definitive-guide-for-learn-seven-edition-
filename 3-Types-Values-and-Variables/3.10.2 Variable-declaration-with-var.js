/** 3.10.2 Variable Declarations with var
In versions of JavaScript before ES6, the only way to declare a variable
 is with the var keyword, and there is no way to declare constants. The
 syntax of var is just like the syntax of let:
 var x;
 var data = [], count = data.length;
 for(var i = 0; i < count; i++) console.log(data[i]);
 Although var and let have the same syntax, there are important
 differences in the way they work:
 Variables declared with var do not have block scope. Instead,
 they are scoped to the body of the containing function no
 matter how deeply nested they are inside that function.
 If you use var outside of a function body, it declares a global
 variable. But global variables declared with var differ from
 globals declared with let in an important way. Globals
 declared with var are implemented as properties of the global
 object (
 §3.7). The global object can be referenced as
 globalThis. So if you write var x = 2; outside of a
 function, it is like you wrote globalThis.x = 2;. Note
 however, that the analogy is not perfect: the properties created
 with global var declarations cannot be deleted with the
 delete operator (
 §4.13.4). Global variables and constants
 declared with let and const are not properties of the global
 object.
 Unlike variables declared with let, it is legal to declare the
 same variable multiple times with var. And because var
 variables have function scope instead of block scope, it is
 actually common to do this kind of redeclaration. The variable
 i is frequently used for integer values, and especially as the
 index variable of for loops. In a function with multiple for
loops, it is typical for each one to begin for(var i = 0;
 .... Because var does not scope these variables to the loop
 body, each of these loops is (harmlessly) re-declaring and re
initializing the same variable.
 One of the most unusual features of var declarations is
 known as hoisting. When a variable is declared with var, the
 declaration is lifted up (or “hoisted”) to the top of the
 enclosing function. The initialization of the variable remains
 where you wrote it, but the definition of the variable moves to
 the top of the function. So variables declared with var can be
 used, without error, anywhere in the enclosing function. If the
 initialization code has not run yet, then the value of the
 variable may be undefined, but you won’t get an error if
 you use the variable before it is initialized. (This can be a
 source of bugs and is one of the important misfeatures that
 let corrects: if you declare a variable with let but attempt
 to use it before the let statement runs, you will get an actual
 error instead of just seeing an undefined value.)
 USING UNDECLARED VARIABLES
 In strict mode (
 §5.6.3), if you attempt to use an undeclared variable, you’ll get a
 reference error when you run your code. Outside of strict mode, however, if you
 assign a value to a name that has not been declared with let, const, or var,
 you’ll end up creating a new global variable. It will be a global no matter now
 deeply nested within functions and blocks your code is, which is almost certainly
 not what you want, is bug-prone, and is one of the best reasons for using strict
 mode!
 Global variables created in this accidental way are like global variables declared
 with var: they define properties of the global object. But unlike the properties
 defined by proper var declarations, these properties can be deleted with the
 delete operator (
 §4.13.4) */
